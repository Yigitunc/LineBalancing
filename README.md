This project was carried out to ensure efficiency and balance in the production processes in a steel
construction factory. Assembly line balancing aims to load workstations on the production line
evenly and balance the duration of jobs at each station. I used C# and MsSQL technologies while
developing this project.

The main objective of this project was to optimize the production line and reduce the waiting times
between different workstations. By balancing the workload across different stations, we were able
to significantly improve the overall efficiency of the factory. This not only helped to increase
productivity but also reduced the chances of delays and errors in the production process.

Overall, this project was a great success and has helped the factory to become more efficient and
productive. It is a testament to the power of technology when applied to real-world problems and
demonstrates how it can be used to make a significant difference in the manufacturing industry.
